However, they don't need write permissions in order to use most of their facilities.</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>Word actors are designed to be used in the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>Representing a world within the game, and displaying basic information about it. It would be possible to use a Journal entry for this, but having an Actor allows a token to be placed on a map.</p></li><li><p>Trade is possible directly with a world. Trade goods can be bought and sold from a world by players, by dragging goods from the World sheet to a Spacecraft sheet.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Plans</h3><ul><li><p>Using them as a shop for buying goods.</p></li><li><p>Tracking Patrons and other 'things of interest'</p></li><li><p>Linking to Traveller Map</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p>"

If one is not found, then it will simply look for the '<strong>Factions</strong>' table in that folder.</p><p>If you want an internationalised version of the tables, then add the language code to the name of the folder, e.g. \"Faction Generator es\" for a Spanish translation of the tables.</p><h3>V13</h3><p>There are differences in how RollTables are used between Foundry v12 and v13. In v12, a roll table simply has a text field. This is used in the description of the faction.</p><p>In v13, they have a name and a description. If you are using v13 you can make use of this for finer grained control over the factions.</p><p>The name is copied into the name of the faction, and the description is copied into the description.
