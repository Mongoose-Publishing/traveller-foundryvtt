Traveller mixes the idea of a 'World' and a 'Star System' together, and the same is done here.</p><p>By default, when a World actor is created, its prototype token is defined as being linked to the Actor object.</p><p>To be useful, Worlds need to be visible to players. However, they don't need write permissions in order to use most of their facilities.</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>Word actors are designed to be used in the following situations:</p><ul><li><p>Representing a world within the game, and displaying basic information about it. It would be possible to use a Journal entry for this, but having an Actor allows a token to be placed on a map.</p></li><li><p>Trade is possible directly with a world. Trade goods can be bought and sold from a world by players, by dragging goods from the World sheet to a Spacecraft sheet.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Plans</h3><ul><li><p>Using them as a shop for buying goods.</p></li><li><p>Tracking Patrons and other 'things of interest'</p></li><li><p>Linking to Traveller Map</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p>"
