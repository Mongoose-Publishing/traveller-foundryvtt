        "content": "<p>Welcome to Foundry! If this is your first time in using the MgT2e system on Foundry, then there are probably lots of things that you want to know. This insn't going to be an introduction to Foundry, but it will guide you through some of the options that you may want to take a look at.</p><p>Currently, MgT2e supports both Foundry V12 and V13. These are slightly different in what options provide, and how they should be setup. Where there are differences, they will be mentioned.</p><h2>Core Options</h2><p>When you create a new world, you may want to first take a look at the <strong>Configure Settings</strong> option on the right hand sidebar. Click on the <strong>Core</strong> filter.</p><h6>Configure Permissions</h6><p>These control what players are able to do. You might find it useful lto allow players to create their own characters. If so, tick the box for the <em>Create New Actors</em> option for Players and Trusted Players.</p><p></p><h3>V13 Only</h3><p>The following options only apply to FoundryVTT v13.</p><p></p><h4>Combat Turn Marker</h4><p>Set to the mgt2e version.</p><p></p><h4>Auto Rotate</h4><p>Probably want to switch this off.</p><p></p><h2>MgT2e Options</h2><p>MgT2e has options of its own. Not all the options are listed, just the ones that are more important.</p><p></p><h4>Year</h4><p>The current year of the campaign. This is used when determining birth date and start age of Travellers. It default to 1105, so if you are playing a game in a different year, then you may want to change this.</p><p></p><h4>Player sheet update broadcasts</h4><p>When a player rolls their characteristics, or adds skills to their character sheet, a chat message is generated to describe the change. By default, this goes to the player that made the change, and the GM. This provides a record of the changes that have been made.</p><p>This is not only to keep players honest, but also makes it easier for modifications to be rolled back if they were done by mistake, or the players changes their mind.</p><p>This option can be changed to only send the message to the player, or to send it to everyone.</p><p></p><h4>GM sheet update broadcasts</h4><p>As for player sheet broadcasts, but this is for when the GM makes a change. It can either be private (GM only) or everyone.</p><p></p><h4>Token vision</h4><p>There is an option for Travellers, NPCs, Creatures and Vehicles (which includes spacecraft). If these are ticked, then when a new actor of that type is created, the prototype token will have their vision switched on. By default, tokens do not have vision.</p><p>If you tend to use tactical combat maps, then this may be useful.</p><p></p><h4>Auto set player character</h4><p>When a player creates an actor, if they do not currently have a default character set, then the new character will be set as their default.</p><p>By default, players cannot create actors, so they need to be given permission to do so (see above).</p><p>Having a default character set means that when macros are used which reference a skill or character, the default character will be used if no other character is selected.</p><p></p><h4>Split attack and damage rolls</h4><p>Normally, when attack rolls are made, the attack and damage roll are done at the same time. If you don't like this, and want to split them into two separate rolls, then enable this option.</p>"

Not all the options are listed, just the ones that are more important.</p><h6>Default to Quick Rolls</h6><p>By default, when you click on a skill on a character sheet, a dialog will pop up allowing you to set the difficulty first. If you hold <em>shift</em> when clicking, the dialog will be skipped and a roll will be made with default options. Enable this option to reverse the behaviour, and make quick rolls the default, and requiring <em>shift</em> to be used to get the dialog.</p><h6>Number of skill columns</h6><p>By default, character sheets display skills in three columns. This can be switched to two for larger text, but is less compact.</p><h6>Skill list format</h6><p>Control whether skills are listed in columns (going down one column, then down the next column) or in rows (across one row, then across the next row).</p><p></p><h2>Macro Hotbar</h2><p>It is possible to add commony used items to the hotbar at the bottom of the screen. There are some useful macros provided by default.</p><p>These macros are part of the MgT2e Base Macros compendium.</p><img src=\"systems/mgt2e/images/docs/hotbar-example.webp\" /><p></p><h4>1D6, 2D6, D66</h4><p>Roll 1D6, 2D6 or D66. Though these aren't hard to roll from the chat, they might be useful to have available as a single click option.</p><p></p><h4>MgT2e Docs</h4><p>A link to this documentation.</p><p></p><h4>Actors</h4><p>It is possible to add an actor to the hotbar by either dragging them from the sidebar, or by dragging their portrait from the character sheet. This provides a one-click way to access your character. If you have multiple characters, you can place all of them on the hot bar.</p><p>If you have the character set as your default, then pressing 'C' will also open your character's sheet.</p><p><strong>GM Note: </strong>IYou might find it useful to have all the player characters added to your hotbar.</p><h5>Skills</h5><p>You can drag a skill from the character sheet to the hotbar as well. If you select the hot bar skill, then the currently selected token will roll the skill. If you don't have a token selected, then it will use your default character if it is set.</p><p>If it is a skill with specialities, only the parent is dragged. However, when you use the skill, it will roll all the specialities that you have points in together. This reduces the number of skills you need to put on the hot bar.</p><p><strong>GM Note:</strong> Since the skill is rolled for the currently selected actor token, you can place common skills on the hotbar. When an actor token needs to make a skill check, you can select them and just simply click the skill.</p><p></p>"

        "content": "<p>The Traveller sheet is used by players to record information about their charactors.</p><p></p><h2>Rolling Characteristics</h2><p>For a new Traveller, there are several ways to roll characteristics.</p><ol><li><p>You can type [[/r 2D6 # Roll Characteristic]]{/r 2D6} six times in the chat window, and manually insert the values into your character sheet.</p></li><li><p>You can type <code>/uwp</code> into the chat window, which will roll six characteristics for you. You can then drag the results to your character sheet. You can add a number to the end (such as <code>/uwp 2</code>) to roll extra sets of dice. The output will always be the highest six rolls.</p></li><li><p>You can click the dice icon to the top right of your characteristics. This will roll each of the characteristics. This is the recommended option for new characters, because if you have non-default characteristics enabled, then these will be rolled as well. When you roll your characteristics in this way, the results will be sent to the chat, giving you and the Referee a record of what was rolled.</p></li></ol><p>Once you have rolled your characteristics, you can drag them around to re-order them. So if you rolled a 6 in STR and a 12 in SOC, and you want to play a strong lower class character, you can drag SOC to STR, and the two values will be swapped.</p><h3>Different Roll Options</h3><p>If you hold down <strong>shift</strong> when clicking the dice option, then average dice will be rolled. This makes it less likely to get extreme values such as 2 or 12 (for each characteristic, five set of rolls will be made, and the middle one chosen).</p><p>This option is more useful for the Referee, who might want to generate a more 'average' set of NPCs.</p><p>If you hold down <strong>ctrl</strong> when clicking the dice option, the current values will be modified betweeen -2 and +2. So if they are all currently 7, then they will range between 5 and 9. Again, this is an option for the Referee. If you have a set of template NPCs (such as security guards), and you want them all to have slightly different characteristics, this option can be used.</p><h2>Skills</h2><p>Characteristics and skills can be rolled by clicking on them. When a skill is rolled, a dialog is popped up allowing you to select the difficulty, roll type (if it is a Boon or Bane) and any dice modifiers. If you hold down SHIFT when rolling a skill, the dialog will be skipped, and default values will be used.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/mgt2e/images/docs/skill_roll.webp\" class=\"centered\" /><p>Each skill has a default characteristic. You can change the characteristic each time you roll a skill. If you tick the 'Remember characteristic' option, then the characteristic you use this time will be remembered as the default for the next roll of this skill.</p><h3>Specialities</h3><p>Specialities are rolled in the same way as individual skills. However, you can also roll the parent skill that has multiple specialities. If you do, then the parent skill result will be displayed, as will the result of all the specialities. Only a single dice roll is made, but the total for each speciality will be shown.</p><p></p><h2>Using the Hotbar</h2><p>You can drag actors and skills to the hotbar, for quick access later.</p><p></p><h2>Player Video Guide</h2><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDB9agK7v9s?si=9eOnUqhuD0AXtaLO\" title=\"YouTube video player\"></iframe><p></p><p></p>"
