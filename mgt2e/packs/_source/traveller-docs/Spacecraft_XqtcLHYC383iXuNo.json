They can then be promoted to crew members.</p><p>Each crew member can be granted one or more roles. A role allows the crew member to perform actions directly from the spacecraft sheet, with predefined difficulties and modifiers.</p><h2>Creating a Role</h2><p>To create a new role, create a \"Crew Role\" item, and give it a name. Actions can then be added to the role depending on what you want the role to do.</p><h3>Chat</h3><p>A chat action will simply output a message to the chat. This can be used for describing actions or flavour text.</p><h3>Skill</h3><p>A skill action will make a skill check using the crew member's own skills. You can select the skill to be rolled, along with optionally specificying a characteristic to use (otherwise the character's default will be used for that skill).</p><p>You can set a skill target number (defaults to 8) and specify a DM to apply to the check. Specifying a target of 6 or adding a DM of +2 have much the same effect, but conceptually they can be different.</p><p>A Jump astrogation check is dificulty 4, with a -1 DM per parsec of distance, so you could either specify a target of 5 for a 1 parsec jump, or set the target to 4 with a DM of -1.</p><h3>Weapon</h3><p>You can assign a weapon to be fired. This requires selecting a weapon from the ship, so until the role is applied to the ship weapon attacks can't be set up.</p><p>For a role assigned to a ship, you will be given a list of weapon mounts to select from.</p><h2>Assign Role to Ship</h2><p>Dragging the crew role item to a ship will add it to the list of available roles. These are listed on the Notes tab of the spacecraft's sheet.</p><p>A role can be edited or deleted from this tab.</p><h2>Assign Role to Crew</h2><p>To assign a role to a crew member, go to the Crew tab and edit a crew member. You will be given a list of available roles to select from. A crew member can have multiple roles assigned to them.</p><p>Once a role is assigned, a button for each task will appear on that crew member's entry. Click it to perform the action.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

A weapon can be assigned to multiple mounts, so you only need to add one of each weapon type.</p><p>The full list of available weapons is displayed in the Notes tab of a spacecraft's sheet.</p><h2>Create a Mount</h2><p>Add a hardware item of type Weapon. This creates a weapon mounting (such as a turret, bay or spinal mount) which can have a weapon assigned to it.</p><p>Weapon mounts appear in the Hardware tab of a spacecraft.</p><h2>Assign Weapon to Mount</h2><p>If you edit the weapon mount, then you should see a list of available weapons that can be assigned to that weapon. Weapons need to have the same mounting type. So a Small Bay weapon mount will only display weapons with a mount type of Small Bay.</p><p>You can normally add only a single weapon to a mount.
