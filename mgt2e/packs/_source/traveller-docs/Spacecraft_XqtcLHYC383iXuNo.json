They can then be promoted to crew members.</p><p>Each crew member can be granted one or more roles. A role allows the crew member to perform actions directly from the spacecraft sheet, with predefined difficulties and modifiers.</p><h2>Creating a Role</h2><p>To create a new role, create a \"Crew Role\" item, and give it a name. Actions can then be added to the role depending on what you want the role to do.</p><h3>Chat</h3><p>A chat action will simply output a message to the chat. This can be used for describing actions or flavour text.</p><h3>Skill</h3><p>A skill action will make a skill check using the crew member's own skills. You can select the skill to be rolled, along with optionally specificying a characteristic to use (otherwise the character's default will be used for that skill).</p><p>You can set a skill target number (defaults to 8) and specify a DM to apply to the check. Specifying a target of 6 or adding a DM of +2 have much the same effect, but conceptually they can be different.</p><p>A Jump astrogation check is dificulty 4, with a -1 DM per parsec of distance, so you could either specify a target of 5 for a 1 parsec jump, or set the target to 4 with a DM of -1.</p><h3>Weapon</h3><p>You can assign a weapon to be fired. This requires selecting a weapon from the ship, so until the role is applied to the ship weapon attacks can't be set up.</p><p>For a role assigned to a ship, you will be given a list of weapon mounts to select from.</p><h2>Assign Role to Ship</h2><p>Dragging the crew role item to a ship will add it to the list of available roles. These are listed on the Notes tab of the spacecraft's sheet.</p><p>A role can be edited or deleted from this tab.</p><h2>Assign Role to Crew</h2><p>To assign a role to a crew member, go to the Crew tab and edit a crew member. You will be given a list of available roles to select from. A crew member can have multiple roles assigned to them.</p><p>Once a role is assigned, a button for each task will appear on that crew member's entry. Click it to perform the action.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

This creates a weapon mounting (such as a turret, bay or spinal mount) which can have a weapon assigned to it.</p><p>Weapon mounts appear in the Hardware tab of a spacecraft.</p><h2>Assign Weapon to Mount</h2><p>If you edit the weapon mount, then you should see a list of available weapons that can be assigned to that weapon. Weapons need to have the same mounting type. So a Small Bay weapon mount will only display weapons with a mount type of Small Bay.</p><p>You can normally add only a single weapon to a mount.

What this represents depends on the item in question.

The base tons is added to the calculated tonnage of the item. If an item up takes up 10% of the hull, plus 5 tons, then set Base TONS to 5. For a 200t ship, the total would be 20t (10%) + 5 tons = 25 tons.</p><p>The Minimum TONs is the smallest this item can be. Some items have a minimum size. This is applied after other tonnage calculations.</p><p></p><h3>Tonnage</h3><h4>%/Rating</h4><p>The item takes up tonnage equal to the rating of the item multiplied by the percentage of the hull. Setting this to 10, and setting the Rating to 3 on a 100t ship, means the item will take up 30%, or 30t.</p><h4>% Hull</h4><p>The item takes up a given percentage of the total hull tonnage. Setting this to 40 on a 200t ship, means the item will take up 80 tons.</p><h4>Tons/Rating</h4><p>The item takes up a number of tons for each rating of the item.</p><h4>Fixed Tons</h4><p>The item takes up a fixed number of tons that never changes. In this case, just set Base TONS to the required value.</p><p></p><h3>Cost</h3><h4>Item TON</h4><p>The cost is per TON of the item.</p><h4>Hull TON</h4><p>The cost is per TON of the ship hull.</p><h4>Rating TON</h4><p>The cost is per Rating assigned to the item.</p><h4>Fixed Cost</h4><p>The cost is a fixed value which never changes.</p><p></p><h3>Power</h3><h4>Item TONs</h4><p>The Power consumption is per TON of the item.</p><h4>Hull TONs</h4><p>The Power consumption is per TON of the ship hull.</p><h4>Rating</h4><p>The Power consumption is per Rating of the item.</p><h4>Fixed Power</h4><p>The Power is a fixed value which never changes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
